<h1>Konsumentor administration interface</h1>
<p>
	The Konsumentor database consists of four main areas
	<ul>
		<li>Article and product listings</li>
		<li>Brands and owner listings</li>
		<li>Ingredients listings</li>
		<li>Reviews connected to items in the listings mentioned above</li>
	</ul>
	By using the tabs you can navigate between theese areas and add information.
</p>

<h2>Products, brands and owners</h2>
<p>
	All <em>articles</em> are unique packages of specific <em>products</em>, sold under a <em>brand</em>.
	As an example, Coca Cola 1L is an <em>article</em>, while Coca Cola is a <em>product</em> sold under the <em>brand</em> Coca Cola,
	the same goes for Coca Cola Light and Coca Cola Cherry, which are different <em>products</em> from the same <em>brand</em>. Fanta and Sprite
	are beverages with different <em>brands</em>, but they are also manufactured by the same <em>owner</em>, The Coca Cola Company.
	<br />
	All articles has a unique GTIN number which can be found encoded in an bar code on its package.
</p>
<p>
	This system enables organisations to review not only specific products or brands, but also international conglomerates. For example all
	the <em>products</em> under the Axe <em>brand</em> can be blacklisted toghether with Pea Soup and toothpaste manufactured by the <em>owner</em> Unilever
	because of under-paid farmers growing coconuts in South America which are used in Ice Cream sold under yet another brand from Unilever.
